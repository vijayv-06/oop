📚 Library Management System — Mini Project (Unit 1)
📌 Objective

To integrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, Collections Framework, and Exception Handling into a single cohesive command-line Java application.

This mini-project demonstrates practical usage of classes, objects, inheritance, collections, custom exceptions, file handling, and user-driven menu-based interaction.

📖 Project Description

The Library Management System allows users to:

Add new books to the library

Register members

Issue books to members

Return books

Calculate late fees using custom exceptions

Maintain all books using a HashMap

Log every operation (add, issue, return) into a text file

🔹 Core Classes:
1. Book

Represents a book with attributes like:

Book ID

Title

Author

Availability status

2. Member

Represents a library member with:

Member ID

Name

List of borrowed books

3. Library

Handles main operations:

Add a book

Issue a book

Return a book

Calculate late fees

Manage collections using HashMap<Integer, Book>

Throw custom exceptions for invalid operations

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (OOP Concepts)

Collections Framework (HashMap, ArrayList)

Exception Handling (Custom Exceptions)

File Handling (Logging to text file)

Command-line Input (Scanner)
